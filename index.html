        <h2>About the Science Fair</h2>
        <p>The Barjo Science Fair is an exciting event for students of Barrington Elementary and Jones Middle School, welcoming all students from kindergarten through 8th grade to participate. It's a hands-on way to get our students engaged in DOING science, sparking curiosity and innovation from a young age.</p>

        <p>The science fair itself will be held on February 6, 2025, from 6pm to 8pm. However, the journey begins much earlier with a kick-off event on September 17, 2024, at 7:30 pm via the Zoom link provided above. Throughout the year, there will be additional meetings to help guide participants in preparing their projects.</p>

        <p>Organized by the Barrington PTO's I Heart Science committee, this science fair not only provides a platform for young scientists to showcase their work but also offers the opportunity for 5th-8th graders to advance to the District 7 Science Fair in March 2025, hosted by Columbus State Community College. There, students can compete for additional prizes and recognition.</p>
